## WHAT IS IT?

This is a continuation off of MileStone 1 project. In this addition, robots leave a pheromone trail when they enounter a large pile of rocks. Other robots can then follow the pheromone trail. 

## HOW IT WORKS

Using global variables, boolean values, and ifelse statements, we are able to create an application with robots that will follow a pheromone trail based on a percentage chance. 

## HOW TO USE IT

Use the sliders to set the number of rocks, and large rock clusters, as well as the percentage chance that robots will follow. 

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Ph label when robots are following a pheromone trail.

## THINGS TO TRY

Adjust sliders to change percentage chance, rock cluster size, number of robots, and angle.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Create rocks with different chemical properties and log them in a counter when collected.

## NETLOGO FEATURES
